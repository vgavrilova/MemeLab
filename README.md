## MemeLab


Hello everyone! 

Recently I#ve decided to make some untrivial projects of my own made with React and I came up with the idea of a meme generator. 


In this app I use an API given by [ImgFlip](https://imgflip.com/api), which renders 100 most popular memes. These are shown in random order on the main page of my SPA. The user can either choose one of them from the gallery or skip forwards/backwards. 


After creating captions, the meme can be generated (a POST request will be sent to the API that gives back a link to the image with captions on it). The number of captions (inputs) is generated automatically depending on the number of allowed text boxes in the meme.



Feel free to contact me if you have any remarks and/or suggestions.


Have fun!
